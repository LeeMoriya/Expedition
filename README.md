Expedition is a new gamemode for Rain World featuring random starting locations, challenges, new abilities and permadeath.

## Difficulty

Expedition mode can be played as all three Slugcats, each with their own pros and cons just like in Story mode, e.g. Monk will permanently unlock gates and Hunter will have more difficult creature spawns, however their limited cycles are disabled in this mode.

There are also Easy, Normal and Hard difficulties to choose from with the following differences:

- Easy: No permadeath
- Normal: Dying at the lowest karma level will end the run
- Hard: Dying at all will end the run (not for the faint of heart)

Karma flowers act as your safety net, as permadeath will not occur if your karma is reinforced when you die. 

## Challenges

There are five types of challenges in Expedition mode:

- Pearls: Challenges related to pearl collecting.
- Combat: Challenges involving creature slaying.
- Echo: Encounter the specified Echo.
- Achievement: Earn the specified achievement.
- Miscellaneous: Challenges that don't fit in other categories

Create your own custom Expeditions with the Challenge Builder!

## Unlocks

Earned by acquiring a certain total number of points from successful expeditions you can unlock the following perks and abilities to assist with future runs:

**Perks**
- Start with reinforced karma
- Start with neuron glow
- Start with a Vulture Mask
- Start with higher karma
- All slugcats move faster

**Abilities**
- Slow Time (Slow down time for a limited duration)
- Spear Expert (You can carry a spear in each hand, and all slugcats can carry a spear on their back)
- Stealth form (A camouflaged form that makes you much harded to detect)
- Double jump (Jump a second time in mid-air, or launch high into the air from a crouched position)
- Mark and Recall (Place a warp marker at your current location and return to it from anywhere)

## Burdens

Burdens are additional penalties you can apply to your expedition to make it harder in return for more points. These are unlocked by completing 1-4 expeditions:

- Hunted: Predators always know where you are, and they are coming.
- Starved: You begin each cycle malnourished and prone to exhaustion.
- Blinded: All regions become shrouded in darkness.
- Doomed: Adjustable cycle limit, more points are earned for fewer cycles.
- Despised: Minimum reputation with all creatures, hunted by Scav death squads.
- Pursued: New creatures may appear in previously visited rooms to ambush you.
- Soaked: Intermittent rain occurs through the cycle.

## Additional Information

The following changes have been made to certain mechanics while on a Expedition:

- Hunter has no cycle limit.
- Moon is alive and well when playing as Hunter.
- Visiting Pebbles will only raise your karma cap by two.
- Hunter must visit echoes first before they will spawn.
- Achievements are not gated behind the Survivor achievement.
- Echoes will not spawn in the first cycle.

With the exception of Echo and Achievement challenges, progress towards challenge completion is only saved when you rest. If you began the cycle with 3/5 creatures killed, killed two more during the cycle, but then die before making it back to a shelter, your progress will be reset to 3/5.

In the event that a challenge becomes impossible to complete, e.g. a pearl becomes lost. You can end the Expedition prematurely by entering the void sea. You will not be forced through the entire sequence, but points for incomplete challenges will not be awarded.

Save data for both your current Expedition and your global progress is stored in your UserData folder.
