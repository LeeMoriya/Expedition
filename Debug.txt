-----------------------------------------------
A core part of Expedition's gameplay loop is
the progression tied to unlocking new abilities
and burdens, because of this please don't
openly share these controls unless asked.
-----------------------------------------------

I strongly recommend making a backup of your
'expeditionMisc.sav' file in your UserData
folder before using these controls.

To enable debug mode hold F11 when entering the
Expedition screen from the Main Menu, you will
hear a sound indicating you have done this.

Note: The Update popup will trigger in debug
mode even if you are on the current version
you can safely ignore this.

Debug mode controls will be listed on the left
of the Expedition menu, they are:

Hold F9 while entering the Expedition screen 
to unlock everything.

Hold P while entering the Expedition screen 
to enable the point button.

Press F1-F6 on the continue screen to complete 
that challenge.

Press F1-F6 while in-game to complete that 
challenge.

Hold F7 while in-game to speed up the cycle.
